/**
 * An instantaneous point on the time-line.
 * <p>
 * This class models a single instantaneous point on the time-line.
 * This might be used to record event time-stamps in the application.
 * <p>
 * The range of an instant requires the storage of a number larger than a {@code long}.
 * To achieve this, the class stores a {@code long} representing epoch-seconds and an
 * {@code int} representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.
 * The epoch-seconds are measured from the standard Java epoch of {@code 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z}
 * where instants after the epoch have positive values, and earlier instants have negative values.
 * For both the epoch-second and nanosecond parts, a larger value is always later on the time-line
 * than a smaller value.
 *
 * <h3>Time-scale</h3>
 * <p>
 * The length of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.
 * This has traditionally been subdivided into 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds,
 * forming a 86400 second day.
 * <p>
 * Modern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks which precisely define an SI second
 * relative to the transitions of a Caesium atom. The length of an SI second was defined
 * to be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately, as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.
 * In addition, over time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.
 * As a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.
 * The actual length of any given day and the amount by which the Earth is slowing
 * are not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.
 * The UT1 time-scale captures the accurate length of day, but is only available some
 * time after the day has completed.
 * <p>
 * The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions
 * of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as <i>leap-seconds</i>.
 * A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.
 * As such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401 SI seconds where
 * necessary in order to keep the day aligned with the Sun.
 * <p>
 * The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.
 * Between 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and
 * alterations to the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway
 * to change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove leap seconds or
 * introduce other changes.
 * <p>
 * Given the complexity of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines
 * its own time-scale, the <i>Java Time-Scale</i>.
 * <p>
 * The Java Time-Scale divides each calendar day into exactly 86400
 * subdivisions, known as seconds.  These seconds may differ from the
 * SI second.  It closely matches the de facto international civil time
 * scale, the definition of which changes from time to time.
 * <p>
 * The Java Time-Scale has slightly different definitions for different
 * segments of the time-line, each based on the consensus international
 * time scale that is used as the basis for civil time. Whenever the
 * internationally-agreed time scale is modified or replaced, a new
 * segment of the Java Time-Scale must be defined for it.  Each segment
 * must meet these requirements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the Java Time-Scale shall closely match the underlying international
 *  civil time scale;</li>
 * <li>the Java Time-Scale shall exactly match the international civil
 *  time scale at noon each day;</li>
 * <li>the Java Time-Scale shall have a precisely-defined relationship to
 *  the international civil time scale.</li>
 * </ul>
 * There are currently, as of 2013, two segments in the Java time-scale.
 * <p>
 * For the segment from 1972-11-03 (exact boundary discussed below) until
 * further notice, the consensus international time scale is UTC (with
 * leap seconds).  In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is identical to
 * <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/">UTC-SLS</a>.
 * This is identical to UTC on days that do not have a leap second.
 * On days that do have a leap second, the leap second is spread equally
 * over the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining the appearance of
 * exactly 86400 seconds per day.
 * <p>
 * For the segment prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,
 * the consensus international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied
 * proleptically, which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the
 * prime meridian (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is
 * identical to the consensus international time scale. The exact
 * boundary between the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC
 * between 1972-11-03T00:00 and 1972-11-04T12:00.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of the Java time-scale using the JSR-310 API are not
 * required to provide any clock that is sub-second accurate, or that
 * progresses monotonically or smoothly. Implementations are therefore
 * not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to otherwise be
 * aware of leap seconds. JSR-310 does, however, require that
 * implementations must document the approach they use when defining a
 * clock representing the current instant.
 * See {@link java.time.Clock Clock} for details on the available clocks.
 * <p>
 * The Java time-scale is used for all date-time classes.
 * This includes {@code Instant}, {@code LocalDate}, {@code LocalTime}, {@code OffsetDateTime},
 * {@code ZonedDateTime} and {@code Duration}.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 *
 * @since 1.8
 * @apiSince 26
